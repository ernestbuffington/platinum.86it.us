We are not done with this update, but due to many requests I decided to release it only to Gold members to assist with the completion of the testing. There are ALOT of changes in this version. I have implemented alot of the code updates and security issue fixes used the the latest RavenNuke release, and I have added several new security features myself. You should find Fusion to be fairly useful once you find out what all the functions do. There are still some areas in the Fusion system that are not complete, but I will update them as we progress. Here is a list of the changes in this Version.
 
* NSN Groups has been upgraded to the latest 1.7.1 Version and integrated into the Modules Administration and Blocks Administration. 
 
* Modules Administration and Blocks Administration is now run by Ajax coding and will make working with these areas alot faster and more user friendly 
 
* The FCK Editor with WYSIWYG ability has been integrated throughout most areas, like News, Journal, Reviews, Content, and other Administrative areas. 
 
* The Donations Module has been recoded so you will no longer have to enter any database info to get it to run. It now draws its database info directly from the Config.php settings. 
 
* An updated Supporters and Affliates Module has been added and secured from the latest known security Exploits. 
 
* The Old Security Code system has been replaced with an New version that works with the newer versions of PHP 5 + 
 
* The Terms of Service editor has been added to the Your Account Module so you can edit it directly there now instead of editing the ******** file. 
 
* An updated Advertisment system has been added that makes it easier for you to place ads on your site. 
 
* There are now two Download systems. One designed for public downloads which is using the heavily modified version of the EDL 2.1 Mod. The other is designed for Private Downloads which you can assign to NSN Groups. 
 
* The Fusion System has been added which is an recoded version of Protector. The details for Fusion are: 
 
Fusion 
 
Fusion is a security system engineered for PHP-Nuke to record extensive logs of session activity, perform security actions, and maintenance actions via the administration panel. Fusion was designed by Goose aka Techgfx and Mister both of which were the creators of the Protector system. I am in the process of picking up the project from where they left off, updating it, adding new features and integrating it into Genesis. Fusion is a more user friendly security system and will not have false triggers which Sentinel has. It is designed for people who like to continually modify their site and not have to worry about continually banning yourself as sentinel does.

Advanced Security 
 
Admin Lock 
 
Assign a user / IP to access admin file 
 
Any other user / IP that is not assigned to have access will be automatically redirected to index.php 
 
Automatic IP Protection 
 
If the above feature is enabled [admin lock] and you have an IP address which changes [dynamic IP address], Fusion will automatically protect your new IP address if it changes 
 
This automatic protection will only apply if you are logged into admin while your IP address dynamically changes. If you are logged out [cookie expired] then you are not automatically protected 
 
Hard IP Protection 
 
Hard protection allows the IP address you are currently logged into the admin file with, to be protected only. This means multiple IP addresses under your username will not be stored. Only 1 IP address under your username will be stored and protected. If this feature is enabled, it will mean a user will be only able to access the administration file from 1 computer / IP only 
 
Dynamic IP addresses will still be hard protected, only if the user does not logout of admin, deeming your cookie session as expired 
 
Admin Lock, Automatic IP Protection and Hard IP Protection are extremely secure, however if you do not have full knowledge of how the features work it can be easy to lock yourself out of your own website. If this happens there are processes you can follow to regain access 
 
Authorised Ban Protection 
 
The ability to protect your IP completely, so it will not be possible to be banned by Fusion 
 
This feature is only available for site administrators 
 
Module Customisation 
 
The ability to create protected properties for modules and assign users/ip addresses to be able to access the protected secure module. All other users/ip addresses that have not been assigned access to the module will be denied. 
 
Users can also be denied access to modules that the general public/community can access. 
 
Bot Crawler Exclusion 
 
Excluding bots / webspiders to be excluded from Fusion page monitoring. Every ip address in this list will not be listed in the log center, thus not tracked. 
 
When the first bot enters your site [i.e. Google 111.111.111.111/crawler01.googlebot.com] you can add googlebot.com and every google crawler will be added automatically. 
 
 
Supercharged Security 
 
FTP Security 
 
FTP security allows you to "secure" files on your webserver. This is done by a dynamic database comparison of server file changes. 
 
There are 3 options; Scan and Add, List Approved, and Secure Scan. 
 
Scan and Add is an inital server scan. It scans the server for any filetype extension [php/html/exe/com/js]. Upon scanning, it will list every file [of the filetype selected] and give you the option to "approve" the files. 
 
List Approved option lists the files that you have approved after the file/filetype scan. Once a file has been approved, it means you are aware that it exists and that the file is safe. 
 
Secure Scan is a scan you perform at any time to see if anything has been altered on your FTP without your knowledge. A Secure Scan can give 3 results: 
1. FTP is secure, no altered .php files have been found 
2. WARNING 
Note: File is approved but file size has changed 
Approved: 3328 byte 
Found: (3329 byte) 
The file was last changed: November 25 2005 18:49:58. 
File: /home/uname/public_html/loc/index.php 
3. WARNING 
File: /home/goose/public_html/fusion1/backend.php is not approved 
The file was last changed: September 09 2005 20:15:55. 
Size: (2389 byte /home/goose/public_html/fusion1/backend.php) 
 
Denial of Service [DoS] Countermeasures 
 
This features prevents users/ip addresses hitting your site too often in a short period of time. There are 3 configurable options; time limit, max hits, and block time. 
 
The time limit variates on the maximum hits limit and is a set time in seconds in which a user/ip address can make a set amount of hits. 
 
The maximum hits is the amount of hits a user/ip address is allowed to hit your site during the time limit set. If the user hits your site too many times, they will be banned for a set amount of seconds. 
 
The ban time is defined in seconds and will automatically block hit breaches for this set time. 
 
Close Site 
 
This allows you to "close" your PHP-Nuke site. All users that are trying to access your site will be redirected automatically to a page with information including a custom set message. 
 
As admin you can access every part of your site, a notice is displayed at the top of your site displaying that the site is closed and only admins can access. 
 
Additionally you can show your sites logo on the closed page. This can be customised via the preview button. 
 
User Monitor System [UMS] 
 
User Monitor System is an advanced tracking system, which allows admins to track any individual users that they define. It is a more extensive and detailed version of the standard log center. 
 
This feature can use significant server resources, which is why only admins are permitted to define which users are tracked through UMS. 
 
Once a user granted to UMS tracking the following information will be initially collected: 
- ID: 1 [note: this is the UMS id / #] 
- IP: xxx.xx.xxx.xxx 
- Proxy: If applicable 
- Host: xxxx-xx-xxx-xxx.xxxxxx.xxx.xxxxxxxx.xxx 
- Name: Username 
- Last here: yyyyy.mm.dd hh:mm:ss 
- Hits: #### 
- User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; Maxthon) 
 
This can also be linked to IP 2 Country to find a users country/city location. 
 
In addition, every users movement will be tracked and logged. This includes: 
- Last used ip address 
- Time of ip usage and user agent used. 
- IP addressed previously used including time of last ip usage and user agent used. 
- Pages visited including times and user agent. 
- What the user did on any page, including GET [http location] and POST [any user input such as login form or forums].
