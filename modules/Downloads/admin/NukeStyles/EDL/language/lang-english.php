define("_NSDLUSENETPBMGD2","Included in the EDL V2.1 is the option to have your Description images resized and enhanced using either the NetPBM Binaries or the GD Libraries. These codes will help reduce the size of the images that are uploaded, so the Download listings will be faster.<br><br>The script will default to the NetPBM Binaries first, then if those binaries are not accesible or not installed properly, the script will search your host for the GD Libraries to use instead. The option we give is to turn these codes off, for the simple fact they can cause trouble, depending on your server. The code is workable, but still needs a little tweaking that will come in a later version of the EDL, to be released shortly after with a few fixes/enhancments.<br><br>With these codes, any uploaded image will then be made into a smaller thumbnail, reducing the size (KB) of each image. This will allow users browsing your downloads section, to have the pages with description images load faster. A small thumbnail will be created for the default display, but when the Pop Up window is clicked, the regular full sized image will show in the new window. The only problem is, when uploading different sizes of images, being the width & height, some images will appear a bit distorted, depending on your Description Image settings (In your right Admin Block). These settings will give you more options on how the default thumbs are displayed.<br><br>The NetPBM Binaries can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.platinumnukepro.com\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a>. You have to download the appropriate binaries depending on your servers Platform, being either Linux, Windows, ect. The GD Libraries have to be installed on your server by your Hosting Company. If you not sure, email your host's support, and ask if GD is installed. For more help, refer to the Readme and Installation docs that came with this module, or use the Support Forums at platinumnukepro.com, by clicking the Link on your admin block.");
