Open up the color picker, choose the colors you wish to use, click the 'Submit' button, and then the color will appear in the form. When you save your general settings, the new colors will be applied to the Additional Details rating display. This display shows all the user submitted ratings; Registered User's, Unregistered User's, and Outside User ratings. An example of the colors you choose, will display under the color fields. Do <strong>not</strong> put a <strong>#</strong> before the color code... the script will do that by default.<br><br>The colors will also be applied to the New Downloads listing. For an example, if you click the New Downloads link from the module's menu, it will take you the default list of new downloads, sorted by 'Date'. The new colors will applied to that table.<br><br>Play around with the colors a bit, to get a feel of the changes. This option is <strong>not</strong> required. If your site uses just one theme, then it would benefit it greatly. If you use more than one theme, then there are other options you can do to change all the colors. It's explained in our Installation guidelines on NukeStyles.com.");

You can create the 'Open' & 'Close' part of the tables, just like you would configure in your normal theme. This gives you the option to create any table design you choose.<br><br>With the 'Design Form' and 'Copy & Paste' modes, you can create any number of tables, which you can activate, deactivate, edit, modify, or any number of different choices.

The close part will control the right and bottom half of your tables, thus splitting the tables in half. This again, is just like in your theme functions. If you need more help on this, view your theme.php file or your tables.php file (if available) in your theme folder. This will give you more understanding on how table structures work.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> The 'Preview Table' function is not working properly.

The option we give is to turn these codes off, for the simple fact they can cause trouble, depending on your server. The code is workable, but still needs a little tweaking that will come in a later version of the EDL, to be released shortly after with a few fixes/enhancments.<br><br>With these codes, any uploaded image will then be made into a smaller thumbnail, reducing the size (KB) of each image. This will allow users browsing your downloads section, to have the pages with description images load faster. A small thumbnail will be created for the default display, but when the Pop Up window is clicked, the regular full sized image will show in the new window. The only problem is, when uploading different sizes of images, being the width & height, some images will appear a bit distorted, depending on your Description Image settings (In your right Admin Block). These settings will give you more options on how the default thumbs are displayed.<br><br>The NetPBM Binaries can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.nukestyles.com\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a>. You have to download the appropriate binaries depending on your servers Platform, being either Linux, Windows, ect. The GD Libraries have to be installed on your server by your Hosting Company.

The reason for this is, on some Themes, it's difficult for User's to read the Code based on the text's color and the background of the Theme. On some sites, it's bright yellow, and on some just plain black. So this option gives you a little control to help your User's out.");

The default message is already dumped in the Database, so you can either modify it, or customize your own. If you delete the entire message, then only the 'Directions' will be displayed for the User.");
