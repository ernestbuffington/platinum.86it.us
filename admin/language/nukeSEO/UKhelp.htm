<div align="center"><h3>Metatags is not everything!</h3></div>

But good and correct MetaTags can help search-engins and their users to find and
 catogorize your site correctly.<br>
Do <strong>not</strong> beleive that MetaTags solve all your problems making your site known -
 there is much more work to do! Do not forget your content.

In this help I can only cover the most known and used MetaTags - for other MetaTags you will need 
to search the net. 
<br>
Before you start: I have have opened the Meta.php file for a more easy access, whatever you update 
it to is your own responsibility. 
<br><br>
At this stage of the module there is only a weak checking of your content.
 
<br>  

The most important MetaTags are:
<ul>
<li>Title
<li><a href="#DESCRIPTION">Description</a>
<li><a href="#KEYWORDS">Keywords</a>
<li><a href="#ROBOTS">Robots</a>
</ul>
See below for further information:
<p>

There are two types of META tags: <a href="#HTTP-EQUIV">HTTP-EQUIV</a> and <a href="#NAME">NAME</a><br>

<a name="HTTP-EQUIV"></a>
<h4>HTTP-EQUIV</h4><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
META HTTP-EQUIV tags are the equivalent of HTTP headers. 
Just like normal headers, META HTTP-EQUIV tags control and direct the actions 
of Web browsers, and are used to refine the information which is provided by 
the actual headers.
HTTP-EQUIV tags are designed to affect the Web browser in the same manner as 
 normal headers.
<ul>
<a name="Expires"></a>
<li><h5>Expires</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
This tells the browser when the document will expire. Can be given as a date 
in RFC850 format or as a number of days (+25)
<br>Example: <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="expires" CONTENT="Wed, 23 Apr 2003 12:25:01 GMT"&gt;</code>
<br>Example: <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="expires" CONTENT="+25"&gt;</code> 
<br>
<a name="Pragma"></a>
<li><h5>Pragma</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
Tell the browser not to cache a page locally. Should work in Netscape Navigator
 but some sites reports that IE ignore this MetaTag. There is only one valid value: "no-cache".
<br>Example <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Pragma" CONTENT="no-cache"&gt;</code>
<br>
<a name="Refresh"></a>
<li><h5>Refresh</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
Specifies the time in seconds before the Web browser reloads the document automatically.
It can also specify a different URL for the browser to load - redirect your site. 
<br>Example <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="0.01;URL=http://www.drdirect-url.com"&gt;</code>
<br>Be aware that if you save this - your site will be redirected as first time you save the MetaTags!!
<br>Also be aware that using refresh can disturb web-crawlers and search engins visiting your site,
 with negative effect on your rating as a consequense.
<br> 
<a name="Set-Cookie"></a>
<li><h5>Set-Cookie</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
This is one way to set a cookie in the user’s Web browser. 
If you set the expiration date, the cookie will be considered permanent saved to disk (until it expires),
 if not date is set it will only be considered valid for the current session and will be erased 
 when closing the browser.
<br>Not all allow their browser to set cookies, sodo not relay on its use. 
<br>Example <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie" CONTENT="cookievalue=your value here;expires=Wed, 23 Apr 2003 12:25:01 GMT; path=/"&gt;</code>  
<br>  
<a name="Window-target">
<li><h5>Window-target</h5><a name="Window-target"></a><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
Specifies the "named window" of the current page, and can be used to prevent a page from
 appearing inside another framed page. This means that the Web browser 
 will try to force the page to go the top frameset.
<br>Only one valid value: "_top" 
<br>Example <code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Window-target" CONTENT="_top"&gt;</code>
<br>
<a name="PICS-Label"></a>
<li><h5>PICS-Label</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
<I>PICS-Label</I> (PICS stands for Platform for Internet Content Selection).
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed this standard for labeling online content for more information go to 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/PICS/">www.w3.org/PICS/</A> ). The W3C’s standard left the actual creation
 of labels to the "labeling services." Anything which has a URL can be labeled, and labels can be
 assigned in two ways. First, a third party labeling service may rate the site, and the labels
 are stored at the actual labeling bureau which resides on the Web server of the labeling service.
 The second method involves the developer or Web site host contacting a rating service, 
 filling out the proper forms, and using the HTML META tag information that the service 
 provides on their pages. One such free service is the 
 <A HREF="http://vancouver-webpages.com/VWP1.0/VWP1.0.gen.html">PICS-Label generator</A> 
 that Vancouver-Webpages provides. It is based on the Vancouver Webpages Canadian PICS ratings, 
 version 1.0, and can be used as a guideline for creating your own PICS-Label META tag.
<br>
 Even PICS-Label was designed as a ratings label, it is also used for code signing, 
 privacy, and intellectual property rights management. A PICS-Label for an entire site  
 can look like this:<BR>   
<br>Example <code>&lt;META http-equiv="PICS-Label" content='(PICS-1.1 "http://vancouver-webpages.com/VWP1.0/" l gen true comment "VWP1.0" by "webmaster@visayas.dk" on "2003.04.19T14:07-0700" for "http://visayas.dk" r (P 0 S 0 V 0 Com 0 Tol 0 Env 0 SF 0 Edu 0 Can 0 MC -3 Gam -1 ))'&gt;</code>

</ul>  

<a name="NAME"></a>
<h4>NAME</h4><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
META tags with a NAME attribute are used for META types which do not correspond
 to normal HTTP headers.
<ul>  
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
<li><h5>DESCRIPTION</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
Widely used by the search engins. Often shown when a site is found in a search: so this is the way your
 site get presented!. use some time to get a neat and good description of what the site is about. Do not will 
 it with keywords - it keeo people away from clicking at the site. Make sure to use words that also can be found 
 in KEYWORDS and on the first page of the site. Due to spam many search engins tries to verify if the
 DESCRIPTION is likely to be about the site by comparing the words - no similarities means spam - 
 lower ration or even black listed.
<br>Example <code>&lt;META NAME="description" CONTENT="Visayas - the heart of Philippines. Interactive information site about Visayas ....."&gt;</code>  
<strong></strong> 
<a name="KEYWORDS"></a>
<li><h5>KEYWORDS</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
Keywords are used to give extra information to search engins. Use important and descriptive words 
 from the site. Add words in common mis-spellings - like 'philipines'. Do not repeat words to 
 improve ratings - the trick do not work, actually it makes it worse!
<br>Example <code>&lt;META NAME="description" CONTENT="This page is about the meaning of life, the universe, mankind and plants."&gt;</code>
<br>
<a name="ROBOTS"></a>
<li><h5>ROBOTS</h5><div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>
This controles how Robots (spiders, webcrawlers, search engines) index a web site.
 Also seek information about the robot.txt file that is used to stop indexing of
 certain foldes and files. For more information visit <a href="http://www.searchengineworld.com/metatag/robots.htm">Robots.txt</a> <br>
 
There are these valid values: all, none, index,noindex,follow,nofollow. When using 2 they are seperated by a comma.
<br><br> 
INDEX means its ok for a robot the page. 
<br>
NOINDEX means its NOT ok for a robot the page. 
<br>
FOLLOW means its ok for a robot to follow the links found on this page. 
<br>
NOFOLLOW means its NOT ok for a robot to follow the links found on this page. 
<br>
ALL=INDEX,FOLLOW
<br>
NONE=NOINDEX,NOFOLLOW. 
<br>Default is ALL
<br>Example <code>&lt;META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="INDEX,FOLLOW"&gt;</code>
