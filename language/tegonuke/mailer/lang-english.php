/**
 * TegoNuke(tm) Mailer: Replaces Native PHP Mail
 *
 * Inspired by Nuke-Evolution and PHPNukeMailer.  Uses a re-written PHPNukeMailer
 * admin module for the administration of the mailer functions and Swift Mailer library
 * of classes to perform the actual mail functions.
 *
 * Will be used to replace PHP mail() function throughout RavenNuke(tm) /
 * PHP-Nuke.  This has become necessary as Hosts have started locking down
 * access to the mail() function and requiring SMTP authentication.
 *
 * PHP versions 5.2+ ONLY
